# mvpg
mvpg (Multi-Variables Polynomial Generator) is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) based command line application which can generate polynomial expressions. Students can use this application to practice polynomial calculating, and verify their results through [Symbolab](https://www.symbolab.com).
Currently mvpg supports linear polynomials and quadratic polynomials.

## Installation

### Install node.js
[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install node.js according to your OS.

### Install git and clone the source code
Install [git for windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) if you are using Windows. Otherwise git will be pre-installed.

### Install node modules
In the terminal above, type the following commands. 
> cd mvpg

> npm install

## Usage
Still in the terminal, type
>node index.js
You will be prompted to input the degree of the polynomials and number of the questions.
After that, the first polynomial will be shown in the terminal. You can calculate it on your own paper. Press 'Enter' in the terminal if you finished and want to check if the result is correct.
